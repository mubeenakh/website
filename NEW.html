        <p align="center" >Kerala, southwestern coastal state of India. 
            Kerala stretches for about 360 miles along the Malabar Coast, varying in width from roughly 20 to 75 miles . It is bordered by the states of Karnataka (formerly Mysore) to the north and Tamil Nadu to the east and by the Arabian Sea to the south and west; it also surrounds Mahe, 
            a segment of the state of Puducherry, on the northwestern coast. The capital is Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum).

               <h3 align="center">Mountains</h3>
                      Eastern Kerala consists of land encroached upon by the Western Ghats; the region thus includes high mountains, gorges, and deep-cut valleys. The wildest lands are covered with dense forests, while other regions lie under tea and coffee plantations 
                      or other forms of cultivation

      <h4 align="center">Backwaters</h4>
        <p >   
            The Kerala backwaters are a network of brackish lagoons and lakes lying parallel
                 to the Arabian Sea coast (known as the Malabar Coast) of Kerala state in southern India, as well as interconnected canals, rivers, and inlets, a labyrinthine system formed by more than 900 kilometres (560 mi) of waterways, 
                and sometimes compared to American bayous.
                The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents 
                creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range.
