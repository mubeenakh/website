        <h3>palakkad hills
        </h3><br>
        <p> Rich in history and blessed with a natural beauty that is hard to replicate, the quaint hill station of Palakkad remains, even today, uncorrupted by the advent of modernity. Palakkad is an important hill station of Kerala and a must visit while planning a Kerala Tour. Once considered to be the stronghold of the Marathas, this picturesque district is even today one of the most important districts of Kerala being home to what can be arguably referred to as the largest mountain pass in the world in terms of area. It is also one of the leading influences in the arena of plantation in Kerala, with its soft, green undulating slopes yielding some of the richest plantations of spices like cardamoms and cloves as well as coffee and tea. Thus, if you are planning a trip to Kerala, make sure you consider a visit to Palakkad as an important part of your tour itinerary.</p>
